# CyberDropDownloaderImporter
imports everything i download with cyberdrop into my collections

really only works with the thotsbay rips, but i guess other folders *could* work.

assumes your collections folders will have at least a shared string with the thotsbay thread title

requires fuzzywuzzy to string match.

use at your own risk

feel free to audit/improve the code


edit line #46 and #49 with your proper full paths

    cyberdrop_prefix = "path/to/CyberDropDownloader/Downloads/"
    collections_prefix = "path/to/collections/"
